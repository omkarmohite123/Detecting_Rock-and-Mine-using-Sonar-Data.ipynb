# Prediction_Of_Rock-and-Mine-using-Sonar-Data.

This project aims to classify the obstacle under sea water as either Rock OR Mines

I have used SONAR data available publicly. This dataset contains 60 numerical features.

This dataset does not contains any missing value and has all the features in numeric form. So, we just only need to find the relevant features. I have used principal component analysis (pca) for removing correlation among the features and reducing the dimension.
